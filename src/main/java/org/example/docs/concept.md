# SynthCorp Smart Manufacturing System — Object & Contextual Concepts

This document outlines the core domain objects and concepts within the **SynthCorp Smart Manufacturing System**, showcasing how each object behaves and what information it holds in different contexts. The aim is to create a clear, human-readable understanding of system components for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
